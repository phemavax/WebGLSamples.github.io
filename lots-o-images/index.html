<body>
<p>These samples attempt to draw as many 32x32 images as possible at 60 frames a second using various techniques.</p>
<p>You should turn off as many other programs as you can and if you are comparing browsers try to make sure the content area is about the same size on both browsers and only run 1 at a time.</p>

<a href="lots-o-images-draw-elements.html">Lots O Images - DrawElements</a>
<p>This sample uses the standard drawElements function call, ones for each image quad.</p>

<p>This sample puts all images quads in a large buffer. The positions of each image are updated in JavaScript and then sent to the GPU with a call to BufferData.</p>

<a href="lots-o-images-buffer-data-opaque.html">Lots O Images - BufferData Opaque</a>
<p>This is the same as "Lots O Images - BufferData" above except blending is turned off since blending is expensive for the GPU.</p>
